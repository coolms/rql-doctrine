/**
 * Every `use CoolMS\...` in src/ must resolve against the INSTALLED tree.
 *
 * This is the check `--prefer-lowest` cannot make on its own. PHP resolves a
 * `use` statement lazily, so a constraint floor that admits a version without
 * the class stays green for as long as no test happens to load the file that
 * imports it. That is not hypothetical: one package in this set declared a
 * floor its own source could not run against, no test referenced either of the
 * two files involved, and its lowest-resolution job passed for ten days.
 *
 * Reading the imports statically removes the dependence on coverage. Under the
 * `lowest` leg of the CI matrix the installed tree IS the floor, so a
 * constraint that has drifted below what the code needs fails here rather than
 * in somebody's application.
